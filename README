gentoo-upg
----------

A wrong and lazy gentoo update script.

WARNING: this script assumes you use a binary kernel for gentoo. I am way too
lazy and stupid to configure a custom kernel. Please do check for kernel
updates before you modify this script.

This script seeks to update gentoo in the most lazy way possible. Please check
that the packages you want to be upgraded are upgraded properly. It also
configures grub to update to the latest binary kernel.

How to use:
sudo make install
sudo make uninstall

The sudo make uninstall does not remove the /man1/ directory even if it is
empty, take note.
